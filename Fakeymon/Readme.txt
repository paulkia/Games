Hello! This project (Fakeymon) was developed by Paul Karmel in 2018.
This is a Java project developed in an attempt to further my understanding of object-oriented programming & data structures.
It was written in the first year of my software programming career, and I was ignorant towards the importance of writing clean code.

This project was written over the course of several months.

All of the sounds, graphics and animations were created from scratch by Paul Karmel.
Please launch the JAR file in order to play the game.
